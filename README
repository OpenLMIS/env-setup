Currently this is mainly focussed to RHEL6/CentOS6 distros

Maintaining DevOps related Project requirements

* Requirements : ruby, chef, knife
  ============

SETUP
=====
Using Chef-Solo
--------------

* Set up your base machine as a knife client. Find more on chef http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Basics
* Set up git on your base machine
*   Run following commands : -
           git clone https://github.com/OpenLMIS/env-setup.git
           cd env-setup/chef-solo
           knife bootstrap vm/ec2-IP/domain-name  --template-file centos6.rb -x username

* The vm/ec2 instance is up and running with latest build.

Using Chef Server
----------------
* Set up a chef server as described in http://blog.frameos.org/2011/05/19/installing-chef-server-0-10-in-rhel-6-scientificlinux-6/
* Set up your base machine as a knife client. Find more on chef http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Basics 
* Bootstrap a new node using ./scripts/bootstrap-templates/centos6.rb. This will register the node to the chef server.
* Upload cookbooks from ./chef/cookbooks to the chef server
* Upload roles from ./chef/roles to the chef server
* Run baserole on the newly set up node
* Node is ready for the application to be deployed.

Cookbook Testing
================
* Using chefspec (rspec based) tool for cookbook testing https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec
* Gemfile in env-setup has the gems loaded.
* Run bundle install to install the gems.
* unit_test rake task is defined in Rakefile.
* Use `bundle exec rake` to test all cookbooks.
* For individual cookbook spec testing use `rspec chef/cookbooks/<cookbook_name>/spec/*_spec.rb`
